React Hook Form

What?
	A small library that helps deal with forms in React.
Why?
	Manage form data
	Submit form data
	Enforce validations
	Provide visual feedback
	React Hook Form provides a simple, scalable, and performant way
	to manage even the most complex of forms

Managing Form State
Every form has a few moving parts that keep changing from the time a user loads the form to the time they submit it
	⚫ current value of every field in the form
	⚫ whether a field has been interacted with
	⚫ whether a field's value has changed form state
	⚫ whether the form is invalid
	⚫ whether a field contains errors

Advantage of rhf:
	⚫ When changing values, component does not re-render.
